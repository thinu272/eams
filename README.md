# ENTRYNEX / EAMS

**Event Access Management System**

## Overview
The ENTRYNEX/EAMS project is a full‑stack application for managing events, ticketing, access control, payments, and staff operations. It includes a React frontend, an Express/Mongoose backend, a MongoDB data layer, and real-time access logging for QR and RFID event scanning.

## Core Identity & Access Model
The system supports both QR and RFID access as interchangeable check-in methods.

- Each attendee record can hold both a `qrToken` and an `rfidTag`.
- The same attendee can be validated by either the QR code or a 10-digit RFID value emitted by a USB keyboard-wedge reader.
- The scan result is logged with a `method` field as either `qr` or `rfid`.
- Ticket purchase flow creates or links an attendee to the purchased ticket, generates a QR code, and optionally allocates an RFID from the event/category inventory.

### Ticket to attendee relationship

    A[Order] --> B[Ticket]
    B --> C[Attendee]
    C --> D[qrToken]
    C --> E[rfidTag]
    D --> F[Entry / Zone Scan]
    E --> F
```

For event access, the system does not treat QR and RFID as separate user identities. They are two ways to resolve the same attendee record.

## Features
- Event creation & management with support for multiple event types
- Ticket ordering, assignment, and QR code generation
- RFID inventory management per event and category
- Event category-based RFID allocation from admin inventory
- Entry and zone scanning by QR code or RFID reader
- RFID Assignment workflow for staff with QR-first approach
- Organizer RFID Assignment Registry (view-only for all assigned tags per event)
- SubOrganizer access to RFID Assignment, Entry Scanner, Zone Scanner, and Manual Search
- Multiple payment methods, including cash-at-entry and online gateways
- Role-based access control (admin, organiser, staff, auditor, attendee, sponsor, etc.)
- Real-time updates via Socket.io
- Notifications through email, SMS, and WhatsApp
- Zone-based access control and logging
- Sponsor package management
- Photo verification for attendees
- Short-link and event-page generation

## RFID Reader Support
The system supports a USB EM4100/TK4100 keyboard-wedge reader. It emits a 10-digit RFID value followed by Enter, so no external RFID SDK is required.

### Reader behavior
- Reader mode is available in entry and zone scanner flows.
- The value is normalized to a 10-digit string and matched against the attendee `rfidTag` field.
- A scan can resolve the same attendee as a QR scan, preserving the same access logic and audit trail.
- The backend logs scans as `method: "rfid"` so staff and admins can distinguish the source without changing the validation rules.

### Admin RFID inventory workflow
Admins can now add RFID codes to the system in two ways:
1. One-by-one via the RFID inventory screen.
2. Bulk import through Excel upload containing RFID codes for a selected event and category.

The inventory is stored as event-scoped tags with category association, and the next available tag is assigned when a ticket is linked to an attendee.

### Organizer RFID Assignment Registry
Organizers can view a read-only registry of all RFID tags assigned to attendees for their events. This view shows:
- RFID tag number
- Attendee details (name, contact, national ID)
- Category (resolved from Ticket model for accuracy)
- Assignment timestamp

### Staff RFID Assignment workflow
Staff can assign RFID tags to attendees using a QR-first approach:
1. Staff scans the attendee's QR code or searches manually
2. Staff selects an available RFID tag from the event inventory
3. RFID is assigned to the attendee
4. Category is automatically resolved from the attendee's ticket

### API support
- `GET /api/rfid/inventory?eventId=<id>` – list RFID inventory for an event (filtered by eventId)
- `POST /api/attendees/:id/rfid` – assign a specific RFID tag to an attendee
- `DELETE /api/attendees/:id/rfid` – clear an attendee RFID tag
- `GET /api/rfid/events/:eventId` – list RFID inventory for an event
- `POST /api/rfid/events/:eventId/tags` – add one or many tags to the inventory
- `POST /api/rfid/events/:eventId/upload` – import RFID codes from Excel

## Entry and Zone Scanning
The system supports two scanning modes for managing attendee access:

### Entry Scanner (Main Entry)
- **Check-In Mode**: Scan QR or RFID to check in attendees at main gates
- **Check-Out Mode**: Scan to check out attendees before they leave
- **Credential Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate check-ins using different credentials (QR→RFID, RFID→QR)
- **Smart Switch**: When an already checked-in attendee tries to check in again, the system suggests switching to Exit mode
- **RFID Assignment**: After successful scan, attendees without RFID can be assigned one directly (if RFID enabled for event)

### Zone Scanner (Inner Zones)
- **Zone Entry**: Allows attendees into specific zones (requires main entry check-in first)
- **Zone Exit**: Records when attendees leave a zone
- **Auto-Toggle**: Automatically switches between Entry/Exit based on current zone state
- **Access Validation**: Validates attendee has access to the specific zone

### Staff Scan Page
Staff can perform entry scans with:
- QR code scanning or manual token entry
- RFID scanning via USB keyboard-wedge reader
- Check-in/Check-out mode toggle
- RFID assignment for non-RFID attendees after successful scan
- Manual override option for staff

### SubOrganizer Dashboard
Sub-organizers have access to:
- **Entry Scanner**: Check-in/out attendees at assigned entry gates
- **Zone Scanner**: Validate zone access for attendees
- **Manual Search**: Find and manage attendees manually
- **Real-time Statistics**: Today's operations (Entry In/Out, Zone In/Out, QR/RFID scans, Denied)
- **Recent Scans**: Activity feed of all entry and zone scans

## RFID Assignment Workflow
RFID assignment follows a QR-first approach:

1. **Staff/SubOrganizer scans attendee QR** or searches manually
2. **If scan successful and attendee has no RFID** (and RFID is enabled for event):
   - "RFID Not Assigned" prompt appears with "Assign RFID" button
3. **Staff scans or enters available RFID tag**
4. **RFID is assigned to the attendee** and updated in real-time
5. **Attendee can now use either QR or RFID** for future check-ins

### RFID Feature Toggle
RFID assignment is only available when the event has RFID enabled (`event.settings.rfidEnabled === true`):
- If disabled: RFID assignment prompts are hidden
- Backend rejects RFID assignment attempts with 403 RFID_DISABLED
- RFID scanning is disabled for the event

## Check-In/Check-Out Flow
### Valid Credential Sequences
| Action | Credential | Result |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Check-In | QR | ✅ Allowed - Attendee checked in |
| Check-In | RFID | ✅ Allowed - Attendee checked in |
| Check-Out | QR | ✅ Allowed - Attendee checked out |
| Check-Out | RFID | ✅ Allowed - Attendee checked out |
| Check-In (already in) | QR/RFID | ❌ Denied - Suggests Switch to Exit |
| Check-Out (not in) | QR/RFID | ❌ Denied - Must check in first |

### Zone Access Rules
- Zone Entry requires: Main entry check-in + zone access in ticket
- Zone Exit requires: Currently in that zone
- Zone scanning auto-determines Entry vs Exit based on current state
