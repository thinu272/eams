## SubOrganiser Permissions Detail
SubOrganisers have scoped access to assigned events with the following capabilities:
- **RFID Assignment** - Assign RFID tags to attendees via QR-first flow or manual search
- **Entry Scanner** - Scan QR codes or RFID at event entrance
- **Zone Scanner** - Scan QR codes or RFID at zone entry points
- **Manual Search** - Search for attendees by name, email, phone, or ticket number
- **Bulk Upload** - Upload RFID tags in bulk via Excel
- **Activity Logs** - View entry and zone scan activity logs
- **Payments** - View payment submissions for assigned events

## Permission Implementation
Permissions are enforced in controller functions via role checks, e.g.:
```js
if (!['MainAdmin', 'MainOrganiser'].includes(req.user.role)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ success: false, message: 'Insufficient permissions' });
}
```
A helper `authorize(allowedRoles)` middleware exists in `backend/src/middleware/authorize.js` that can be used as:
```js
router.post('/events', protect, authorize(['MainAdmin', 'MainOrganiser']), createEvent);
```
The `authorize` middleware simply verifies `allowedRoles.includes(req.user.role)` and returns 403 otherwise.

## Role Hierarchy
```
MainAdmin > MainOrganiser > SubOrganiser > Staff > Volunteer > Attendee
Auditor (parallel, read‑only)
Sponsor (parallel, limited read)
```
Higher roles inherit all permissions of the lower ones, except where explicitly overridden.

---
*Derived from the `User` model (`backend/src/models/User.js`) and the `authorize` middleware.*
